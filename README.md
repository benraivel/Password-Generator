# Password Generator
## because firefox won't just let you generate one

A simple password generator using the python secrets module. Can create passwords with or without uppercase & lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

I make no guarantees about the security of using this. I think the code is fine, but maybe the output of the jupyter notebook is recoverable? At the very least please don't use the passwords that appear in the commits.
